# Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider

[![DataDog Service Catalog](https://github.com/arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider/actions/workflows/automated-testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider/actions/workflows/automated-testing.yml)

Welcome to the Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider!

The Datadog Service catalog is a marvelous new way to track which services are in production. Your telemetry data is presented in the Service Catalog in a way where you can see the health of your services, and the health of the services that depend on them, all in one place. Most importantly, the Service Catalog helps you support your services in any environment.

With the Service Catalog registration API, you can supply the Service Catalog with all of the support information you might want:

- The name of the service
- The team which supports and maintains the service
- The email address of the team
- The URL of the service's documentation, which has a special subtype for runbooks (we _all_ need more runbooks)
- The URL of the service's source code
- The URL of the service's dashboards and performance metrics
- Integration information for important services like Slack, MS Teams, PagerDuty, and Opsgenie

You can use this to register your services with the Service Catalog, and then use the Service Catalog to find the information you need to support your services.

Supporting services can be tricky, and the Datadog Service Catalog can make it easier for team members who aren't familiar with your service to support it. The Service Catalog can also help you find the information you need to support your services, and help you find the right people to support your services.

## Wait, but why?

Datadog already has methods for supplying this information. Why do we need another one? The answer is pretty simple: constraints.

Datadog has a super useful GitHub integration which allows you to register your service with a simple JSON file in your repository, after you install their GitHub plugin and give it read access to your repository. This is great, but if you're using GitOps for deployments and such, sometimes more integrations and webhooks can be concerning.

In order to get the benefits of the Service Catalog without having to open GitHub up to those integrations, this GitHub Action will allow you to register your services with the Service Catalog using a GitHub Action, which then allows you to have full control and visibility over this process. It also gives you full control over when this information is sent to Datadog.

## Supported Metadata Fields

The registration API's links are below, and it takes input per its own JSON schema (also below), but this Action seeks to make things simpler and easier still! Here's a simplified list of the metadata fields that are supported by the Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider:

| Field | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `datadog-hostname` | The Datadog host to use for the integration, which varies by Datadog customer. [See here for more details:](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/) <https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/>. Please make sure that you are sure about this value. You'll get an error if it's incorrect. | Yes | `https://api.datadoghq.com` |
| `datadog-key` | The Datadog API key to use for the integration. _Please_ use [Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to secure your secrets. | Yes | |
| `datadog-app-key` | The Datadog Application key to use for the integration. _Please_ use [Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to secure your secrets. | Yes | |
| `service-name` | The name of the service. This must be unique across all services. | Yes | |
| `team` | The team that owns the service. | Yes | |
| `email` | The email address of the team that owns the service. | Yes | |
| `slack-support-channel` | The Slack channel where folks can get support for the service. **This must be a Slack URL.** | No | |
| `repo` | The GitHub repository where the service is hosted. This is a convenience input for when you only have one repository for the service. You must either have this value, or you must have values specified in the `repos` object. | No | |

Here's a larger set of metadata fields that are supported by the Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider:

| Field | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `contacts` | The list of contacts for the service. Each of these contacts is an object. Keep in mind that `email` and `slack-support-channel` are already included as contacts. This list should be in addition to that. These values are supplied as objects, but due to the limitations of GitHub Actions, please supply these object properties as a multi-line string. | No | `[]` |
| `contacts[].name` | The name of the contact. | Yes | |
| `contacts[].type` | The type of the contact. Acceptable values are: `email`, `slack`, and `microsoft-teams` | Yes | |
| `contacts[].value` | The value of the contact. For example, if the type is `email`, this would be the email address. | Yes | |
| `repos` | The list of GitHub repositories that are part of the service. You must supply at least one repository. The repositories are supplied as objects, but due to the limitations of GitHub Actions, please supply these object properties as a multi-line string. | Yes | `[]` |
| `repos[].name` | The name of the repository. | Yes | |
| `repos[].url` | The URL of the repository. | Yes | |
| `repos[].provider` | The provider of the repository. Acceptable values are: `Github`. | No | |
| `tags` | The list of tags that are associated with the service. This should be a list of key-value pairs separated by colons. | No | |
| `links` | A list of links associated with the service. These links are objects with a variety of properties, but due to the limitations of GitHub Actions, please supply these object properties as a multi-line string. | No | `[]` |
| `links[].name` | The name of the link. | Yes | |
| `links[].url` | The URL of the link. | Yes | |
| `links[].type` | The type for the link. Acceptable values are: `doc`, `wiki`, `runbook`, `url`, `repo`, `dashboard`, `oncall`, `code`, and `link` | Yes | |
| `docs` | A list of documentation links associated with the service. These links are objects with a variety of properties, but due to the limitations of GitHub Actions, please supply these object properties as a multi-line string. | No | `[]` |
| `docs[].name` | The name of the document. | Yes | |
| `docs[].url` | The URL of the document. | Yes | |

| `integrations.opsgenie` | The OpsGenie details for the service. | No | |
| `integrations.opsgenie.service_url` | The service URL for the OpsGenie integration. A team URL will work, but if you want on-call metadata then make sure that this URL is to a service, not a team. | Yes | |
| `integrations.opsgenie.region` | The region for the OpsGenie integration. Acceptable values are `US` and `EU`. | No | |
| `integrations.pagerduty` | The PagerDuty URL for the service. | No | |

## Example

### Simplest possible example

Here I have a simple example of a service that has a single repository, and the least amount of metadata possible.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider@v1
        with:
          datadog-hostname: api.us5.datadoghq.com
          datadog-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_KEY }}
          datadog-app-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_APP_KEY }}
          service-name: my-service
          team: my-team
          email: my-team@my-organization-which-totally-exists.com
```

### Simpler service with more metadata

In this example, you can see that my team is called "Global Greetings," and I have a single repository for my service. I also have a single document, and a single link.

My slack support channel is listed by URL, and the email address is present. At the bottom you can also see the OpsGenie integration details.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider@v1
        with:
          datadog-hostname: api.us5.datadoghq.com
          datadog-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          datadog-app-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY }}
          service-name: hello-world
          team: Global Greetings
          email: global.greetings@fake-email-host.com
          slack-support-channel: 'https://team-name-here.slack.com/archives/ABC123'
          repos: |
            - name: hello-world
              url: https://github.com/fake-org/hello-world
              provider: github
          docs: |
            - name: outage-runbook
              url: https://fake-org.github.io/hello-world-outage-runbook
              provider: github
          integrations: |
            opsgenie:
              service_url: https://fake-org.hello-world.opsgenie.com
              region: US
```

### Example with multiple repositories

This example is the same as above, except that I have a multiple repositories involved.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider@v1
        with:
          datadog-hostname: api.us5.datadoghq.com
          datadog-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          datadog-app-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY }}
          service-name: hello-world
          team: Global Greetings
          email: global.greetings@fake-email-host.com
          slack-support-channel: 'https://team-name-here.slack.com/archives/ABC123'
          repos: |
            - name: hello-world
              url: https://github.com/fake-org/hello-world
              provider: github
            - name: some-library
              url: https://github.com/fake-org/some-library
              provider: github
          docs: |
            - name: outage-runbook
              url: https://fake-org.github.io/hello-world-outage-runbook
              provider: github
          integrations: |
            opsgenie:
              service_url: https://fake-org.hello-world.opsgenie.com
              region: US
```

### The whole enchilada

This is the maximal configuration you could use, in a complete workflow that you could copy-and-paste. It's a bit verbose, but it shows you all the options you have complete with "why."

```yaml
---
name: Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider

on:
  # This will make my service definition get pushed any time I push a change
  # to the main branch of my repository.
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # This trigger will allow me to manually run the Action in GitHub.
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # This uses the custom action to push the service definition to Datadog.
      - uses: arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider@v1
        with:
          # You should use GitHub's encrypted secrets feature to manage secrets for Datadog.
          # Don't store your secrets in your workflow files, and don't do anything fancy to get them.
          # GitHub already gave us a great tool for managing secrets, and it's super easy to use.
          datadog-hostname: api.us5.datadoghq.com
          datadog-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          datadog-app-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY }}

          # This maps to the `dd-service` field in Datadog, it's just the name of your service.
          service-name: hello-world
          
          # The name of the team which owns and/or supports the service.
          team: Global Greetings

          # The email address of the team which owns and/or supports the service.
          email: global.greetings@fake-email-host.com
          
          # The URL of the Slack channel where support for the service is handled.
          # Keep in mind, this _must_ be a URL. To get the URL, right-click on the channel
          # in the Slack app, and select "Copy link" in the "Copy" submenu.
          slack-support-channel: 'https://team-name-here.slack.com/archives/ABC123'
          
          # For repos, you'll obviously want to have the repository for your service. If your service
          # is made up of multiple repositories, you can add them here as well. Note that we're using a multi-line string here. That multi-line string will be parsed as YAML, I didn't typo.
          repos: |
            - name: hello-world (primary service repo)
              url: https://github.com/fake-org/hello-world

```

## Quick note on triggers

While there are a number of triggers you can use for this workflow, I recommend that you limit the triggers here to `workflow_dispatch` and `push` for your primary branch. Keep in mind that Datadog is going to always overwrite the service catalog definition whenever you run this action.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Common Causes | Potential Solutions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Error: The Datadog API key is required.` | You didn't set the `datadog-key` input. | Set the `datadog-key` input. |
| `Error: The Datadog application key is required.` | You didn't set the `datadog-app-key` input. | Set the `datadog-app-key` input. |
| `Error: The Datadog hostname is required.` | You didn't set the `datadog-hostname` input. | Set the `datadog-hostname` input. |
| `Error: The service name is required.` | You didn't set the `service-name` input. | Set the `service-name` input. |
| `Error: The team name is required.` | You didn't set the `team` input. | Set the `team` input. |
| `Error: The team email is required.` | You didn't set the `email` input. | Set the `email` input. |
| Datadog gives a 403 when you try to push the service definition. | You didn't set the `datadog-key` or `datadog-app-key` inputs correctly, or you've got the wrong `datadog-hostname` value for your account. | Check the `datadog-hostname` first, that's easier to check since GitHub Actions secrets will not show the value to you. After you've verified that, if you still have a 403, verify that you set the `datadog-key` and `datadog-app-key` inputs correctly. If that continues to cause trouble, you may want to visit the [API documentation for the API that this Action uses](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/service-definition/?code-lang=curl#create-or-update-service-definition) and make sure that it's functional with the host name and credentials you've provided. |
